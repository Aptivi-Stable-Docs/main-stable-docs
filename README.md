# Stable Manuals

{% hint style="danger" %}
**We apologize for your inconvenience, but it seems that uncontrollable internet connectivity and electricity issues in our environment is causing the release to be delayed, alongside other factors. We are extremely sorry for the delayed release of Textify 2.4.0, and will conduct an internal investigation. Meanwhile, we'll stop further development of all projects until this investigation is complete and our environment is back to usable states.**
{% endhint %}

Stable manuals are manuals that are written for a specific version of a library or an application. This is intended to make such manuals accessible to users who still use old versions. This page is populated with eligible applications and libraries that are listed in the support schedule as you can see in the below page:
